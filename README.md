This is a simple python script for converting a single Hexis .hbxml beatmap file to a single .osu beatmap file. This is the first version so there may be some bugs I didn't catch.

One major thing to note. This converts Hexis hold notes into osu! mania hold notes. This will not work in gameplay for osu! but makes it easier to visualize the objects in the editor. 
If you wish to convert these maps to be playable in osu! I do recomment modifying hold notes to regular sliders or circles.
